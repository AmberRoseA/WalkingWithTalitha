## FEAUTURES

## Key Existing Features

### Navigation
The navigation bar is a consistent feature located at the top of every page on our website. It provides users with easy access to key sections of the site. Here are some important details about the navigation bar:
Welcome Message: In the top right corner of the navigation bar, you'll find a "Welcome" text accompanied by a charming dog icon. This "Welcome" message also serves as an anchor link, allowing users to quickly return to the home page by clicking on it. - This element stays the same for all screen sizes.

Menu Options: The navigation bar includes the following menu options and links:
Home: Takes you to the main page of the website.
Services: Link directs user to services page.
About: Link directs user to about page.
Contact: Link directs user to contact information and form.

Visual Feedback: When a menu option is selected, the text will transform to white, with a dark green background, and will be underlined. This visual feedback is designed to enhance the user experience, making it clear which page you are currently on.

Fixed Position: The navigation bar is "fixed," which means it remains at the top of the screen even as users scroll down the page. This design feature ensures that users don't have to scroll back to the top when they want to access a different page, providing a seamless and convenient browsing experience.

![navigation_Bar](readme_files/nav-bar.png)

### Responsive Navigation Bar

This website features a responsive navigation bar to ensure an optimal viewing experience on smaller screens, such as mobile devices. Here's how it adapts:

* Mobile-Friendly Design: On smaller screens, the navigation bar undergoes a transformation. Instead of displaying all pages simultaneously, we utilize a menu icon, conserving screen space while keeping the font size intact.
* Dropdown Menu: When users click the menu icon, a dropdown menu appears, presenting the available options in a clear and user-friendly manner. This makes it easy for users to select the page they wish to visit.
* Auto-Collapse: The dropdown menu automatically collapses once a page has been selected, maintaining a tidy and uncluttered interface.
* Consistent Styling: Just like in the desktop version, the selected page on the mobile navigation bar maintains the same styling, distinguishing it from the other available options. This ensures a seamless and visually consistent user experience across all screen sizes.

*![navigation_bar_close](readme_files/navbar-closed.png) *![navigation_bar_close](readme_files/navbar-open.png)

### Web Tab

When you open the website in a browser tab, you will immediately notice the presence of the business name
'Walking With Talitha' along with a favicon displaying the logo of the business owner. This design element ensures that viewers can easily identify the tab and contributes to a polished and professional appearance.

![fitcon](readme_files/fitcon-logo.png)

### Header Image & Logo

* The header, featuring a border collie set against a green field backdrop that matches the color scheme of the web page, 
provides an immediate visual cue about the site's theme. Underneath the header, you'll find information that clarifies the 
site's purpose, which is dog walking and sitting services. It also highlights the business owner's qualifications in the 
industry and provides the location of the business. These elements are thoughtfully arranged to ensure a clean and uncluttered 
appearance.

* The logo, which serves as a home page link, is subtly positioned in the corner of the header image. It doesn't overpower the 
design but remains noticeable, akin to a brand label.

* As demonstrated in the responsive navigation elements shown in previous images, the header image adapts to smaller screens, 
allowing the headers to occupy more space and the logo to increase in size, fitting nicely within the curve of the dog's back.

![header](readme_files/header-img.png)

### Home Page 'Your Trusted Dog Walking Companion'

![home_page](readme_files/home-feat.jpg)


#### Responsive Home Page 'Your Trusted Dog Walking Companion'

![home_mobile](readme_files/home-mobile.png)

### Footer

* In line with the green-themed design, the footer takes on a slightly darker shade compared to the navigation and header. 
This subtle contrast enhances the page's sharpness against the white background of the main content.

* The footer remains a fixed element throughout, ensuring that social media icons and links, as well as the 
copyright notice, are constantly visible to the visitors. The business owner maintains active profiles on Facebook and 
Instagram. When users click on the icons, the corresponding social media sites open in separate tabs, clearly indicated by 
Arial labels to convey this action.

![footer](readme_files/footer.png)

### Services Page

#### 'Su-Paw-Star Service' table section

* On the services page, the primary feature is a table that outlines the different service types, their associated costs, 
and the typical timeframes. This table serves as an informative section of the site, enabling visitors to easily understand 
the owner's offerings and pricing structure.

* Beneath the table, it is explained that the prices and durations of services can vary based on individual dog characteristics
 and the owner's specific requirements, emphasises the highly personalized nature of the service. 
* This information is presented in keeping with the current color theme, which incorporates dark and light greens with subtle 
hints of yellow, enhancing the visual appeal. The table is neatly outlined with a yellow border, and the top row is made more 
prominent, clearly labeled as 'Service Cost' and 'Times'

![service_table](readme_files/service-feat.png)

#### 'Paw-sibilities: Our Service in Bone-fide Detail' service breakdown section

* The "Breakdown of Services" section on the service page provides a detailed explanation of 
each service listed in the table. Each section is accompanied by a background image, and the text background has a slight 
opacity, allowing the description to be visible while still enjoying the images.

![service_breakdown](readme_files/service-breakdown-feat.png)

* The breakdown sections adapt to different screen sizes, adapting so that the images span the width of the screen 
while maintaining their required height.

![service_breakdown_mobile](readme_files/service-breakdown-feat-mobile.png)

### About Page

#### Business Owner Intro (section on About Page)

* In the "About" section, we first encounter a brief introduction to the business owner, accompanied by an image of her 
alongside her loyal border collie, a recurring presence throughout the website. This personal touch reinforces the independent 
nature of the business and allows viewers to develop a sense of the person they may entrust with their cherished pets.

* On larger screens, the image is positioned beside the introductory text, with a background color resembling the navigation 
bar. This design choice serves to break up the page layout, eliminating unnecessary white space and preventing the page from 
appearing overly empty.

![about_intro](readme_files/about-feat.png)

##### Responsive Business Owner Intro (section on About Page)

* On smaller screens, the introductory text seamlessly overlays the full-width image, eliminating the need for a color background, 
creating a more compact and aesthetically pleasing display.

![about_intro_mobile](readme_files/about-tal-mobile.png)

#### Reasons Why (section on About Page)

* The "Reasons Why" section on the About page features concise, punchy sentences designed to provide viewers with compelling 
reasons to choose her as their dog walker/sitter. Key buzz words are highlighted in bold to make them stand out, with yellow 
text for high contrast against the green background

![reasons_why](readme_files/about-why-feat.png)


#### Happy Customer Gallery on About Page

* The "Happy Customer" section on the about page offers a visual representation of the business owner's 
current clientele and their feedback on her services. This section highlights the outstanding reviews and 
testimonials, both from satisfied human clients and her delighted canine companions. It's a delightful place to 
explore for those who love seeing lots of pictures of adorable dogs

![happy_customers_gallery](readme_files/aboutpage-gallery.png)

#### Responsive Happy Customer Gallery on About Page

* This section is designed to be screen-responsive, gracefully adjusting its layout as the screen size 
decreases, all while maintaining the visual proportions and overall presentation.

![happy_customers_gallery_ipad_screens](readme_files/aboutpage-gallery-ipad.png)

![happy_customers_gallery_mobile_screens](readme_files/aboutpage-gallery-mobile.png)


#### Contact Page --Form

* Upon the initial loading of the contact page, a stylish picture of two dogs sitting on a log serves as the 
background for the contact form. The form includes fields for first name, last name, email, and a message, 
with ample spacing to prevent crowding, labels and placeholder text for guidance. Names and email types also have autofil values for easier user experiance.

*The submit button will change to a green color when selected. If the fields are filled in incorrectly or left blank, 
an error message will appear, preventing users from submitting their message until the issues are resolved.

![contact_form](readme_files/completed-feat.png)

#### Responsive Contact Page --Form

* This design is responsive and compatible with all screen types.

![contact_form_ipad_screen](readme_files/contactpage-form-ipad.png)

![contact_form_mobile_screen](readme_files/contactpage-form-mobile.png)

*Once the user has correctly filled in all form elements and their message has been sent, 
a new tab will automatically open, leading them to a confirmation page. This page is specifically designed 
to notify the user that their message has been successfully sent and acknowledged, and it features an image of a 
friendly border collie to warmly greet them.

#### Confirmation Page- New Tab upon Correct Completion Of Form

![cofirmation_page](readme_files/completed-feat.png)


### Contact Page

* Below the contact form on the contact page, you'll find the business owner's email and phone number for 
those who prefer to use these contact methods. The color theme remains consistent and prominently displayed in a big 
and bold format to ensure it catches your attention.

![contact_details](readme_files/contactpage-details.png)

#### Maps

* Display maps at the bottom of the contact page, serving as a visual guide to the business's operating areas. 
When users click on these maps, a new tab will open, leading them directly to Google Maps with the location visible on the 
screen. These maps are also equipped with an "aria-label" for enhanced accessibility.

### WIREFRAMES

#### Mobile Screens

##### Home Screen 

![home_page](readme_files/home-page-mobile-wireframe.JPG)
        
Included two essential anchors on all screen sizes:
Logo Anchor: The website logo, when clicked, serves as an anchor to bring the viewer back to the index.html page, offering a convenient way to return to the homepage.
Top Right Welcome Sign: In the top right corner of the navigation bar, you will find a welcome sign. Clicking this sign also acts as an anchor to return to the homepage, ensuring easy and intuitive navigation.

![home_page_nav](readme_files/home-page-navtoggle-wireframe.jpg)
        
 The navigation toggle bar is positioned at the top of the mobile screen. Placing it at the top ensures it's the first element a viewer sees when they access the website. This prominent placement enhances accessibility and encourages users to interact with the navigation options.

##### Service Screen

![service_page](readme_files/service-page-mobile-wireframe.jpg)

* Please note at this point that the wireframe images, specifically the nav and footer do not match the previous wireframes, they would still have the same layout on the web doc. 
The nav and footer would move as the screen scrolls being in a fixed or sticky positions. The heading elements and image would also be on this page like all the other pages but would not be visable as we scroll down.
The service page is a vital one in this site as has all the importan information about the services provided, it needs to be readable and clear so the viewer has all the information possible to hand. Would start with a table element then after a more detail explantion of each service underneath.

##### About Screen

*Aim to make this section more intimate by allowing viewers to get to know the owner on a personal level. Through a brief and friendly introduction, we provide insights into her background, passion for the business, and what drives her commitment to providing exceptional services. This personal touch is a key factor in securing viewers' trust to create a sense of familiarity and relatability, building trust and rapport with the audience.
Incorporating images of reviews from satisfied customers adds authenticity and credibility through the gallery showcasing these qualities. To add an endearing and charming element to our "About" section, we include images of our happy dog customers. This not only showcases the love and care we provide to our furry clients but also brings a smile to the viewer's face. It's a delightful way to create an emotional connection with our audience.

![about_page_contact_page](readme_files/about-contact-mobile-wireframe.jpg)
        
##### Contact Screen

* One of the primary features of the "Contact" page is the inclusion of a user-friendly contact form. This form is designed to allow visitors to email the owner directly through the website. It provides an efficient and convenient means of communication, particularly for those who prefer not to phone or navigate through various social media channels. With all fields classed as REQUIRED, no accidental email will be sent without all the require information being keyed in.
For those who prefer to explore the owner's social media accounts, we've placed prominent links in the footer of the website. These links are designed to open in a new tab, ensuring that users don't lose access to the website.
