## FEAUTURES

## Key Existing Features

### Navigation
The navigation bar is a consistent feature located at the top of every page on our website. It provides users with easy access to key sections of the site. Here are some important details about the navigation bar:
Welcome Message: In the top right corner of the navigation bar, you'll find a "Welcome" text accompanied by a charming dog icon. This "Welcome" message also serves as an anchor link, allowing users to quickly return to the home page by clicking on it. - This element stays the same for all screen sizes.

Menu Options: The navigation bar includes the following menu options and links:
Home: Takes you to the main page of the website.
Services: Link directs user to services page.
About: Link directs user to about page.
Contact: Link directs user to contact information and form.

Visual Feedback: When a menu option is selected, the text will transform to white, with a dark green background, and will be underlined. This visual feedback is designed to enhance the user experience, making it clear which page you are currently on.

Fixed Position: The navigation bar is "fixed," which means it remains at the top of the screen even as users scroll down the page. This design feature ensures that users don't have to scroll back to the top when they want to access a different page, providing a seamless and convenient browsing experience.

### Responsive Navigation Bar
Our website features a responsive navigation bar to ensure an optimal viewing experience on smaller screens, such as mobile devices. Here's how it adapts:
Mobile-Friendly Design: On smaller screens, the navigation bar undergoes a transformation. Instead of displaying all pages simultaneously, we utilize a menu icon, conserving screen space while keeping the font size intact.
Dropdown Menu: When users click the menu icon, a dropdown menu appears, presenting the available options in a clear and user-friendly manner. This makes it easy for users to select the page they wish to visit.
Auto-Collapse: The dropdown menu automatically collapses once a page has been selected, maintaining a tidy and uncluttered interface.
Consistent Styling: Just like in the desktop version, the selected page on the mobile navigation bar maintains the same styling, distinguishing it from the other available options. This ensures a seamless and visually consistent user experience across all screen sizes.

### WIREFRAMES

#### Mobile Screens

##### Home Screen 

*![home_page](../WalkingWithTalitha/readme.docs/home-page-mobile-wireframe.JPG)
        
Included two essential anchors on all screen sizes:
Logo Anchor: The website logo, when clicked, serves as an anchor to bring the viewer back to the index.html page, offering a convenient way to return to the homepage.
Top Right Welcome Sign: In the top right corner of the navigation bar, you will find a welcome sign. Clicking this sign also acts as an anchor to return to the homepage, ensuring easy and intuitive navigation.

*![home_page~nav](../WalkingWithTalitha/readme.docs/home-page-navtoggle-wireframe.jpg)
        
 The navigation toggle bar is positioned at the top of the mobile screen. Placing it at the top ensures it's the first element a viewer sees when they access the website. This prominent placement enhances accessibility and encourages users to interact with the navigation options.

##### Service Screen

*![service_page](../WalkingWithTalitha/readme.docs/service-page-mobile-wireframe.jpg)

Please note at this point that the wireframe images, specifically the nav and footer do not match the previous wireframes, they would still have the same layout on the web doc. 
The nav and footer would move as the screen scrolls being in a fixed or sticky positions. The heading elements and image would also be on this page like all the other pages but would not be visable as we scroll down.
The service page is a vital one in this site as has all the importan information about the services provided, it needs to be readable and clear so the viewer has all the information possible to hand. Would start with a table element then after a more detail explantion of each service underneath.

##### About Screen

Aim to make this section more intimate by allowing viewers to get to know the owner on a personal level. Through a brief and friendly introduction, we provide insights into her background, passion for the business, and what drives her commitment to providing exceptional services. This personal touch is a key factor in securing viewers' trust to create a sense of familiarity and relatability, building trust and rapport with the audience.
Incorporating images of reviews from satisfied customers adds authenticity and credibility through the gallery showcasing these qualities. To add an endearing and charming element to our "About" section, we include images of our happy dog customers. This not only showcases the love and care we provide to our furry clients but also brings a smile to the viewer's face. It's a delightful way to create an emotional connection with our audience.

*![about_page, contact_page](../WalkingWithTalitha/readme.docs/about-contact-mobile-wireframe.jpg)
        
##### Contact Screen

One of the primary features of the "Contact" page is the inclusion of a user-friendly contact form. This form is designed to allow visitors to email the owner directly through the website. It provides an efficient and convenient means of communication, particularly for those who prefer not to phone or navigate through various social media channels. With all fields classed as REQUIRED, no accidental email will be sent without all the require information being keyed in.
*For those who prefer to explore the owner's social media accounts, we've placed prominent links in the footer of the website. These links are designed to open in a new tab, ensuring that users don't lose access to the website
