She has walked Cosmo for me since March this year. She has done longer stints while we have been away, weekend and days in the week. She is flexible and always helps when she can even on some last minute walks. Cosmo is always happy when he returns and is super happy to see her. I know that she cares for him and all the other dogs as if they were her own. Communication is excellent and comso is always smiling in the pictures that she send. I fully trust her and know I can rely on her 100%. Thank you for all the walks you have given us'">
